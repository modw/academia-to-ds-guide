.. important::

    * Use language the hiring manager will understand.
    * Use keywords the recruiter will recognize.

When you submit your resume for consideration, you want to pass two,
sometimes three filters:

1. (sometimes) The resume needs to be "picked" by an automated system 
   that parses your resume for keywords.
2. The resume needs to be selected by a recruiter as a potential candidate.
3. The hiring manager (which is often your boss-to-be) needs to approve it 
   so that the interviewing process can begin.

The first point is usually accomplished by listing relevant objective
information about yourself, the candidate. That would include information
on your qualifications, past jobs, years of experience etc. Keywords help here too.

The second point is more about the subjective assessment of the recruiter
on how much of your qualities and past experience match the actual job
description. Basically, it is the recruiters best guess of how well
you would do at the job.

However, the recruiter is usually coached to screen these resumes, so in the
end the hiring manager, with hands on context of the actual job, can make
their best guess of whether or not you should be interview.

One thing in common with these three steps, is that **it is key that they understand
how well you fit their open position**, and as such it is in your best interest to not
distract them with experience that they will not be able to contextualize. For this
reason, refrain from using terminology specific to your academic sphere, and instead 
rephrase your experience in common industry-friendly terms.
