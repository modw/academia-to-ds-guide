Resume Guide
============

Language Guide
--------------

.. tip::

    * Use language the hiring manager will understand.
    * Use keywords the recruiter will recognize.

When you submit your resume for consideration, you want to pass two,
sometimes three filters:

1. (sometimes) The resume needs to be "picked" by an automated system 
   that parses your resume for keywords.
2. The resume needs to be selected by a recruiter as a potential candidate.
3. The hiring manager (which is often your boss-to-be) needs to approve it 
   so that the interviewing process can begin.

The first point is usually accomplished by listing relevant objective
information about yourself, the candidate. That would include information
on your qualifications, past jobs, years of experience etc. Keywords help here too.

The second point is more about the subjective assessment of the recruiter
on how much of your qualities and past experience match the actual job
description. Basically, it is the recruiters best guess of how well
you would do at the job.

However, the recruiter is usually coached to screen these resumes, so in the
end the hiring manager, with hands on context of the actual job, can make
their best guess of whether or not you should be interview.

One thing in common with these three steps, is that **it is key that they understand
how well you fit their open position**, and as such it is in your best interest to not
distract them with experience that they will not be able to contextualize. For this
reason, refrain from using terminology specific to your academic sphere, and instead 
rephrase your experience in common industry-friendly terms.


    **Bad**: Solved Schrodinger's equation under Joh Doe's condition.

    **Less bad**: Used Python and linear algebra to design a novel differential equation solver to accomplish XYZ.

    **Good**: Accomplished XYZ by designing a novel Python library using IJK.

.. tip::
    * Tailor your resume to either the specific job posting or 
      the type of role you're applying to.
    * Highlight your transferable skills relevant to the job.

If this is your first time writing a resume for industry, we
recommend you start by looking at general resume writing guides.
Still, there are somewhat standard sections almost every resumes
have.

Summary
    * Provide a brief statement with your background and motivations.
    * Don't write more than a couple of lines.

Education
    * List degrees, institutions, and dates of graduation.
    * Don't add unnecessary online credentials here. Your 
      data science skills should be highlighted through experience 
      and projects. If you want to show that you're constantly
      learning and studying, just say that and state how many online
      courses you've taken and of what kind.

Experience/Projects
    * List every relevant project you been a part of, what role
      you played in it and what you have accomplished.
    * Use this section to demonstrate as many relevant skills 
      to the role as possible. Phrase everything in terms of
      transferable skills.
    * Make sure to use industry friendly language and terminology.
      Use the job posting as a guide for keywords to include here.
    * Try to include relevant tools you've used. Don't highlight 
      irrelevant tool. For example, if you used `Mathematica`
      instead of `Python`, highlight that you used a "scripted
      language" instead.

Technical Skills
    * List all the skills and tools that you regularly use and
      your level of proficiency. For example, you might say that
      you use the Python data science stack daily, and have a working
      knowledge of SQL.

Soft Skills
    * Highlight your experience and accomplishments using skills
      such as leadership, project management, public speaking, 
      writing, mentoring, teaching, etc.



Style Guide
-----------
The standard resume style is constantly evolved, and you're better
off googling for templates to get a good sense. However, these best
practices generally hold up:

* Use a modern design.
* Use readable fonts with appropriate kerning and line spaces.
* Keep it to one page only unless you absolutely can't.
* Make the sections distinguishable and easy to follow. The recruiter
  won't spend much time on your resume, so make sure it is easily
  readable.
